Description:
  A study of the jet production is association with W bosons has been perormed, in
  events with the W decaying to a muon. Jets are required to have pT>30 GeV and |eta|<2.4. 
  Muons are required to have pT>25 and |eta|<2.1. Jets are only considered if they are 
  separated from the muon by DeltaR>0.5. Muons are dressed with photons in a cone of 0.1 
  around the muon.

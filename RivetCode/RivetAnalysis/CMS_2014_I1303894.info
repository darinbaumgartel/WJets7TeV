RunInfo:
   Run MC generators with W decaying leptonically at 7TeV com energy. A large number of events are required to populate the high jet multiplicity region. Suitable results can be achieved with 85M events.
Beams: [p+, p+]
Energies: [7000]
PtCuts: 
  Leading Muon Pt>25GeV and Leading Muon |eta|<2.1 
  Jet pT>30GeV and |eta|<2.4
Description:
  A study of the jet production is association with W bosons has been perormed, in
  events with the W decaying to a muon. Jets are required to have pT>30 GeV and |eta|<2.4. 
  Muons are required to have pT>25 and |eta|<2.1. Jets are only considered if they are 
  separated from the muon by DeltaR>0.5. Muons are dressed with photons in a cone of 0.1 
  around the muon.
